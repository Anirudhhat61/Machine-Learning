Occupancy Detection Project

Using the provided data, supervised machine learning classification 
algorithms have been trained on training data set and tested against two 
test sets.

The original paper is “Accurate occupancy detection of an office room from light, 
temperature, humidity and CO2 measurements using statistical learning models” 
from Luis M. Candanedo and Véronique Feldheim.

The algorithms trained and tested on this project are,

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine


For every algorithm, a table has been presented with several parameters
and different feature combinations. At the end, there is a table that 
shows every algorithm with their best parameters and feature combinations 
alongside their scores for this project.


The initial dataset orginally were in text file but now converted to CSV file
for better view and analysis. It would be attached in zip file.
Train.csv - datatraining.txt
Test1.csv - datatest.txt
Test2.csv - datatest2.txt


Following libraries are uncomman and would be needed to run the iypnb file 
without any errors.

1. pyplot
2. sns
3. export_graphviz
4. plotly
